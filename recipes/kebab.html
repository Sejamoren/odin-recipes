    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make your own version of this takeaway favourite, complete with chilli and garlic sauces. Serve your homemade doner kebab with pitta bread and shredded cabbage</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g lamb mince</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>Â¼ tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>sunflower oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <h3>Step</h3>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip all the ingredients except the oil into a food processor with a large pinch of salt and lots of ground pepper. Pulse until everything is combined and chopped together. You can also just squish everything together in a bowl but this will give you a looser finish.</li>
        <li><h3>Step</h3>Oil a large sheet of foil, tip the meat mix in the middle and mould to a very thick sausage, roughly the shape of an aubergine. Roll up the foil tightly, twisting up the ends to create a Christmas cracker shape.</li>
        <li><h3>Step</h3>Lay on a shallow roasting tin and roast in the oven for 35-40 mins, turning occasionally, or until a digital cooking thermometer reads 75C when pierced in the middle. Leave the kebab to cool a little, then unwrap the foil. Place back on the tray and brown under the grill or with a blowtorch.</li>
        <li><h3>Step</h3>Place on a board and carve into thin slices. For full doner mode, you can hold the kebab up with a roasting fork or metal skewer and carve. Serve with warm pitta bread and any of the other accompaniments, including our chilli sauce and garlic yogurt sauce.</li>
